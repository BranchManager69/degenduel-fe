## Wait, Wait, Wait - Hold On A Second!

Guys, I appreciate the detailed response, but we have some serious questions here before anyone starts changing anything.

## üõë Primary Question: Who Should Actually Change?

You're telling me:
- Frontend expects `{tokens: [...], pagination: {...}}`
- Backend provides `{data: [...], pagination: {...}}`
- Both teams are offering to make changes

**But here's my question:** WHO SHOULD ACTUALLY BE DOING THE UPDATING HERE?

I need you to tell me definitively:
1. **Is this a frontend problem** because we're using the wrong key name?
2. **Is this a backend problem** because you changed the API format at some point?
3. **What was the ORIGINAL API contract?** Did someone break it?

## üîç The Search Endpoint Inconsistency

Hold on, I just noticed something in your response:

- `/api/tokens` returns `{data: [...]}`
- `/api/tokens/search` returns `{tokens: [...]}`
- `/api/tokens/trending` returns `{data: [...]}`

**WHY ARE YOUR ENDPOINTS INCONSISTENT?** 

This tells me someone, somewhere, knew the frontend expected `tokens` because the search endpoint uses it correctly!

## üö® The Trending Endpoint - What's The Deal?

You mentioned `/api/tokens/trending` with these limitations:
- Limited to 200 tokens max
- No pagination support
- "Pre-ranked by DegenDuel algorithm"

**My Questions:**
1. **WHY is it limited to 200?** Is this a performance thing? A business decision? A random number someone picked?
2. **Could we add pagination to trending?** Would that break something?
3. **What was the shortcut here?** Because limiting to 200 tokens smells like someone took a shortcut for some reason

## üìä The Million Token Question

You casually mentioned there are **1,165,177+ tokens** available.

1. **Do users actually need to see 1M+ tokens?** That seems insane
2. **Should we even be showing all these?** Are most of them garbage?
3. **Is the trending endpoint the RIGHT solution** and we're just overthinking this?

## ü§î Historical Context Needed

Before anyone changes ANYTHING, I need to know:

1. **When did the API format change?** The frontend code clearly expected `tokens` at some point
2. **Who decided on `data` vs `tokens`?** Was there a reason?
3. **Are there API design standards** we should be following?
4. **Who else consumes these endpoints?** Will changing break other stuff?

## üí° My Gut Feeling

Something tells me the **trending endpoint might be the right answer** but that 200 limit is suspicious. It feels like:
- Someone realized showing 1M+ tokens is ridiculous
- Created trending to show quality tokens
- Arbitrarily limited to 200 for... reasons?
- Never added pagination because... lazy? performance? who knows?

## üéØ What I Actually Need From You

1. **Tell me the history** - Why do endpoints use different key names?
2. **Explain the 200 limit** - Is this technical or just arbitrary?
3. **Can trending have pagination?** - Or would that defeat its purpose?
4. **Who should change?** - Don't both offer, tell me who SHOULD change
5. **What's the right UX?** - Should users see 1M tokens or curated trending?

## üî• Bottom Line

Before we make ANY changes:
- I need to understand WHY things are the way they are
- I need to know if trending endpoint + pagination is the better solution
- I need to know who broke the original API contract (if anyone)
- I need to understand that 200 token limit

**Don't start coding anything yet.** Let's figure out the RIGHT solution, not just the quick fix.

**Status:** Awaiting clarification on above questions  
**Action:** NO CODE CHANGES until we understand the full picture

PS: That 200 token limit on trending really bugs me. It feels like an arbitrary restriction that's hiding the real solution here.
