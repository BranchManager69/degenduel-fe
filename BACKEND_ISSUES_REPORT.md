# Backend Issues Report

**Date:** June 6, 2025  
**Reporter:** Frontend Development Team  
**Severity:** High - Multiple Critical API Failures  

## Executive Summary

Multiple backend API endpoints are failing, causing degraded user experience and broken functionality. The referral system is completely non-functional, contest data is malformed, and WebSocket services are experiencing timeout issues.

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Referral System Complete Failure (CRITICAL)

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/referrals/signup` - Returns API errors
- `/api/referrals/stats` - Returns API errors

**Impact:**
- Users cannot track referral signups
- Affiliate dashboard is broken
- Revenue tracking for referrals is non-functional

**Error Details:**
```
[API Error] /api/referrals/signup: Object
[Invite] Failed to track signup: Error: API Error
[API Error] /api/referrals/stats: Object
Error fetching referral data: Error: API Error
```

**Business Impact:** HIGH - Referral program completely broken, affecting user acquisition and affiliate revenue.

### 2. Contest Data Format Issues (HIGH)

**Issue:** Contest participation check returning invalid response format

**Error Details:**
```
[DD-API] Invalid participation check response format for contest 769: Object
```

**Impact:**
- Contest participation validation failing
- Potential contest entry issues
- Data integrity problems

**Business Impact:** HIGH - Could prevent users from joining contests or cause incorrect contest state.

### 3. WebSocket Service Timeouts (MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Affected Services:**
- Notifications WebSocket
- Wallet WebSocket  
- Terminal Data WebSocket
- Contest Detail updates

**Error Details:**
```
[Notifications] Timed out waiting for data
[Wallet WebSocket] Timed out waiting for data
[TerminalData WebSocket] Timed out waiting for data
[ContestDetailPage] WebSocket update error: Connection temporarily unavailable
```

**Impact:**
- Real-time notifications not working
- Live wallet balance updates failing
- Contest live updates broken
- Terminal functionality degraded

**Business Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Significantly impacts user experience with real-time features.

## Secondary Issues (Lower Priority)

### 4. Wallet Integration Warnings

**Details:**
```
Phantom was registered as a Standard Wallet. The Wallet Adapter for Phantom can be removed from your app.
Solflare was registered as a Standard Wallet. The Wallet Adapter for Solflare can be removed from your app.
```

**Impact:** LOW - Cosmetic console warnings, no functional impact
**Business Impact:** LOW - Code cleanup opportunity

### 5. MetaMask Extension Error

**Details:**
```
[ChromeTransport] connectChrome error: Error: MetaMask extension not found
```

**Impact:** LOW - Expected behavior when MetaMask not installed
**Business Impact:** NONE - Normal operation

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours)
1. **Investigate and fix referral API endpoints** - Complete system failure
2. **Fix contest participation response format** - Data integrity issue
3. **Investigate WebSocket service stability** - Multiple timeout issues

### Short Term (Within 1 Week)
1. Review WebSocket connection handling and timeout configurations
2. Implement better error handling for API failures
3. Add monitoring for these critical endpoints

### Long Term
1. Implement comprehensive API health monitoring
2. Add automated tests for critical user flows
3. Consider circuit breaker patterns for failing services

## Technical Details

### Environment
- Frontend: DegenDuel React Application
- WebSocket Protocol: WSS via `/api/v69/ws`
- Authentication: JWT-based
- Platform: Production environment

### Error Patterns
- API errors are generic "API Error" messages without detailed error codes
- WebSocket timeouts suggest backend service availability issues
- Contest data format suggests schema validation problems
