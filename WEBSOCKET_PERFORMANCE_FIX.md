# WebSocket Performance Fix Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Individual Token Subscriptions
**File**: `src/hooks/websocket/topic-hooks/useTokenData.ts`

- **Commented out** the subscription logic that was creating 300+ individual WebSocket channels
- **Removed** the processing of individual token price updates
- Now relies solely on batch updates from the `market_data` topic

### 2. Why This Should Fix the Issues

**Before**:
- 311 tokens × 3-4 components = ~900-1200 individual subscriptions
- Each token sending updates independently = ~10 messages/second
- Each message processed by all listeners = 460ms+ delays

**After**:
- Only 1 subscription to `market_data` per component
- Batch updates every 30 seconds as designed
- Significantly reduced message processing overhead

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:dev &
   ```

2. **Monitor WebSocket activity** in browser console:
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for `[useTokenData]` logs
   - You should see:
     - "SKIPPING INDIVIDUAL TOKEN UPDATE" messages (confirming individual updates are disabled)
     - Batch updates from `market_data` topic
     - No more rapid-fire individual token updates

3. **Check performance**:
   - Token prices should still update (via batch updates)
   - Page should feel more responsive
   - CPU usage should be lower

## Next Steps if This Works

1. **Implement Global Token Store** (recommended):
   ```typescript
   // Create a global Zustand store for token data
   // Only one component subscribes to WebSocket
   // All others read from the store
   ```

2. **Server-Side Optimization**:
   - Consider removing individual token channels entirely
   - Optimize batch update frequency based on needs

3. **Re-enable with Throttling** (if individual updates are needed):
   - Add message batching/debouncing
   - Limit subscription count
   - Use virtual scrolling to only subscribe to visible tokens

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, simply uncomment the disabled code sections in `useTokenData.ts`.

## Performance Metrics to Track

- WebSocket message frequency (should drop from ~10/sec to ~0.03/sec)
- React DevTools render frequency
- Browser CPU usage
- Page responsiveness during token updates
