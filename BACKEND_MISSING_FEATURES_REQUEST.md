# Backend Missing Features Request

## Overview
This document outlines the missing backend features needed to create a world-class real-time leaderboard experience for DegenDuel contests. These features are prioritized based on their impact on user engagement and the overall contest experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Missing Data (Priority Order)

### 1. Real-Time Activity Feed
- [ ] `last_activity_timestamp` - Know who's actively trading
  **STATUS: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** - Trade activity is tracked in `contest_portfolio_trades` table with `executed_at` timestamp. The leaderboard endpoint can be enhanced to include this data.
- [ ] `recent_trades` array - Show last 3-5 trades per participant
  **STATUS: DATA EXISTS, NEEDS ENDPOINT** - All trades are stored in `contest_portfolio_trades`. New endpoint needed: `GET /api/contests/:id/participants/:wallet/recent-trades`
- [ ] `trade_frequency` - Trades per hour metric
  **STATUS: CAN BE CALCULATED** - Data exists, needs aggregation query to calculate trades per hour from existing trade history.
- [ ] `is_currently_active` - Boolean for live activity indicator
  **STATUS: CAN BE DERIVED** - Can be calculated from `last_activity_timestamp` (active if traded within last 30 seconds).

**Use Case**: Display a pulsing green dot on participants who traded within the last 30 seconds, creating a sense of live competition.

### 2. Portfolio Composition During Contest âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] Full `portfolio` array with token data during active contests:
  - [x] `token_address` - **AVAILABLE** via `tokens.contract_address` 
  - [x] `token_symbol` - **AVAILABLE** via enhanced portfolio endpoint
  - [x] `token_name` - **AVAILABLE** via enhanced portfolio endpoint
  - [x] `token_image_url` - **AVAILABLE** via enhanced portfolio endpoint
  - [x] `weight` (percentage of portfolio) - **IMPLEMENTED** as `weight_percentage` 
  - [x] `quantity` - **AVAILABLE** in enhanced portfolio response
  - [x] `entry_price` - **IMPLEMENTED** from contest_token_prices table
  - [x] `current_price` - **AVAILABLE** from tokens table
  - [x] `token_pnl` (profit/loss for this token) - **IMPLEMENTED** as `pnl_amount`
  - [x] `token_pnl_percentage` - **IMPLEMENTED** as `pnl_percentage`

**ENDPOINT**: `GET /api/contests/:id/portfolio/:wallet` now returns complete portfolio composition with all requested fields.

**Use Case**: Rich hover effects showing exact portfolio breakdown and individual token performance. âœ… **READY FOR FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION**

### 3. Historical Performance Data âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** 
- [x] `performance_history` array with time-series data:
  - [x] `timestamp` - **AVAILABLE** via chart data endpoint
  - [x] `portfolio_value` - **AVAILABLE** via chart data endpoint  
  - [x] `rank_at_time` - **STORED** in portfolio history, needs endpoint enhancement
- [x] Minimum 30 data points (e.g., every minute for 30 minutes) - **IMPLEMENTED** with configurable intervals (5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- [x] Optional: `sparkline_data` pre-calculated array for quick rendering - **IMPLEMENTED** as `chart_preview` in WebSocket updates (96 data points for 24 hours)

**ENDPOINTS**: 
- `GET /api/contests/:id/portfolio/:wallet/chart` - Full historical data
