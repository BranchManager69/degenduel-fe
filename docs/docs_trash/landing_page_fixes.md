# Landing Page Fixes

## HeroTitle Animation Enhancement

1. **More Dramatic Collision Effect**:
   - Implemented a true collision animation with the words physically "slamming" into each other
   - Added a white flash effect at the moment of impact
   - Created a shockwave effect that ripples outward
   - Added particle debris that shoots out from the collision point

2. **Improved Timing and Sequencing**:
   - Carefully sequenced each step of the animation
   - Used `useEffect` with precise timing for each animation phase
   - Extended the total animation time to 8 seconds for a more satisfying experience
   - Made the animation skippable by clicking anywhere

3. **Visual Polish**:
   - Enhanced text glow and shadow effects during the collision
   - Made the text movements more dramatic with proper spring physics
   - Improved the appearance of the "Ã—" character with better timing

## Contest Cards Fix

1. **Complete Reimplementation**:
   - Replaced the non-functioning components with directly rendered cards
   - Built cards directly in the LandingPage component to ensure visibility
   - Maintained all the key information from the original cards

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Ensured consistent styling with the rest of the page
   - Added proper hover effects to make cards interactive
   - Included clear status indicators (Live/Upcoming)
   - Used appropriate color coding for different contest types

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Maintained the responsive grid layout
   - Ensured cards display properly on all screen sizes
   - Added appropriate loading states

4. **Complete User Flow**:
   - Linked cards to the appropriate contest detail pages
   - Added action buttons that clearly indicate the next steps
   - Included an empty state for when no contests are available

## TypeScript and Build Fixes

1. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**:
   - Removed unused state variables
   - Fixed import statements
   - Ensured proper typing throughout the components

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Properly cleaned up all timeouts in the animation component
   - Used conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary components
   - Ensured efficient loading of contest data

The landing page now provides a stunning first impression with the dramatic logo animation and properly functioning contest cards, creating a cohesive and engaging experience for users.
