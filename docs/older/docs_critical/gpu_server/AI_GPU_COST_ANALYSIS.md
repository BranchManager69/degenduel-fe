## Usage Scenarios

### Development Phase

#### Scenario 1: Minimal Usage (4 hours/day)
| GPU Type | Daily Hours | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| A10      | 4           | $2.40      | $72          |
| RTX A6000 | 4          | $4.40      | $132         |

#### Scenario 2: Moderate Development (8 hours/day)
| GPU Type | Daily Hours | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| A10      | 8           | $4.80      | $144         |
| RTX A6000 | 8          | $8.80      | $264         |

#### Scenario 3: Heavy Development (12 hours/day)
| GPU Type | Daily Hours | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| A10      | 12          | $7.20      | $216         |
| RTX A6000 | 12         | $13.20     | $396         |

### Production Phase

#### Scenario 4: Always-on Service (24 hours/day)
| GPU Type | Daily Hours | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| RTX A6000 | 24         | $26.40     | $792         |
| A100 (40GB) | 24       | $47.76     | $1,433       |
| A100 (80GB) | 24       | $84.00     | $2,520       |

## Auto-shutdown Cost Optimization

Using auto-shutdown scripts that detect inactivity and shut down the instance after 5 minutes of no API calls could reduce costs by an estimated 15-30% compared to manual management, depending on usage patterns.

For example:
- Development with auto-shutdown (RTX A6000, 12 nominal hours): ~$330/month (vs $396)
- Production with auto-shutdown during low-traffic hours (A100 40GB): ~$1,100/month (vs $1,433)

## Implementation Recommendation

### Development Phase
1. **Setup**: RTX A6000 with auto-shutdown
2. **Monthly Budget**: $350-400
3. **Configuration**: Auto-shutdown after 5 minutes of inactivity
4. **Integration**: Webhook API from DegenDuel server to Lambda Labs API to start instance on demand

### Production Phase
1. **Setup**: A100 (40GB) for optimal performance/cost balance
2. **Monthly Budget**: $1,500-2,000
3. **Configuration**: Always-on during peak hours, auto-shutdown during low-traffic periods
4. **Scaling**: Add additional instances if demand exceeds capacity

## Lambda Labs Quick Start Steps

1. Create Lambda Labs account
2. Set up billing and access credentials
3. Deploy RTX A6000 instance with Stable Diffusion pre-installed
4. Configure auto-shutdown script
5. Set up webhook endpoint for starting the instance
6. Integrate with DegenDuel backend services
7. Test the end-to-end pipeline

## Cost Comparison with Midjourney Subscription

| Service | Monthly Cost | Restrictions | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Midjourney Basic | $10 | ~200 images/month | Very limited |
| Midjourney Standard | $30 | 15h fast generations | Good for individual use |
| Midjourney Pro | $60 | 30h fast generations | Better concurrency |
| RTX A6000 on Lambda | $396 | ~3,000 images/hour | Full control, customizable |
| A100 (40GB) on Lambda | $716 | ~6,000 images/hour | High performance |

## Conclusion

For development, we recommend starting with the RTX A6000 GPU with auto-shutdown to balance performance and cost. This provides excellent image generation capabilities at a reasonable cost, with potential for savings through proper automation of the instance lifecycle.

For production, the A100 (40GB) offers the best balance of performance and cost if high throughput is required, while staying within the specified budget range ($2,500/month).
