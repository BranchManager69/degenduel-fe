# üìù Progress Report

- DegenDuel is an innovative gamified portfolio tracker project that allows users to connect their Solana wallets and compete in crypto token-picking contests. Inspired by platforms like DraftKings, it aims to create an engaging, skill-based gaming experience with features such as bonuses, streaks, and events.
- The project is built using a tech stack that includes Node.js with TypeScript for the backend, a React-based frontend, and a PostgreSQL database hosted on an Ubuntu VPS server. It leverages Express for the API, Nginx as a reverse proxy, Prisma ORM for database management, and Solana Web3 for authentication and login.
- Throughout the development process, the project has undergone various phases of refinement, including debugging, enhancing the user experience, expanding the vision, redesigning the interface, addressing technical challenges, and integrating strategic gameplay elements. The introduction of an AI Game Master concept adds a unique layer of dynamic scoring and persuasion-based gameplay.
- The project targets diverse audiences, including users, investors, potential partners, and AI assistants, with tailored documentation planned for each group. A token launch is also in the pipeline, offering specific utility within the platform.
- As the project progresses, efforts are being made to streamline the development workflow by splitting the codebase into separate frontend and backend repositories, iteratively diagnosing and fixing architectural issues, and seeking convenient ways to manage server configurations.
- The integration of autonomous AI agents, such as those based on the Eliza framework, is being explored to allow for AI participation as players, leveraging trading strategies to compete in contests.
- With an impending beta launch on the horizon, the team is preparing a mysterious and intriguing announcement to generate excitement and highlight upcoming functionalities without revealing all details. A separate launch announcement for the actual opening day is set to follow.
