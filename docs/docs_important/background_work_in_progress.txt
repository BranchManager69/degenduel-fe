# MARKET DODGEBALL SCENE - ENHANCEMENT PLAN

## COMPLETED
- ✅ Dynamic camera starting directly overhead with cinematic fly-in
- ✅ Smooth camera descent that orbits the court
- ✅ Transition to game position as action begins

## NEXT STEPS - PRIORITIZED

### 1️⃣ CORE DODGEBALL MECHANICS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Players rush to center to grab balls, then retreat to their side
- Implement proper throwing mechanics with targeting
- Add dodging AI with appropriate player movement
- Enable catching mechanics with success/failure states
- Track player states: ready, carrying, throwing, dodging, eliminated
- Victory celebration with confetti particles for winners

### 2️⃣ PLAYER & BALL VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS
- **Enhanced Player Orbs:**
  - Team-colored cores with outer translucent shell
  - Intensity glow based on state (brightest when carrying ball)
  - Dramatic aura burst when successfully catching a ball
  - Spin-based particle trails that intensify with speed
  - Slight shape deformation based on direction and speed

- **Advanced Ball Effects:**
  - Motion blur/trails with length proportional to throw speed
  - Visible spin with rotation lines and particle wake
  - Color intensity that increases with ball velocity
  - Mini-particle explosion on impacts
  - Trajectory hints for computer-controlled throws

### 3️⃣ ENVIRONMENT & LIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS
- **Court Enhancement:**
  - Dynamic ripple effects under moving orbs
  - Team-colored reflection patterns based on position
  - Subtle court glow under areas of high activity

- **Lighting System:**
  - Spotlight tracking for balls in flight
  - Player-cast shadows with correct perspective
  - Subtle flash highlights for successful catches/hits
  - Ambient environment lighting that responds to game state

### 4️⃣ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (FOR LATER)
- GPU-accelerated particle systems
- Instanced rendering for similar objects
- Level-of-detail adjustments based on action intensity
- Shader-based effects instead of geometry

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Using THREE.InstancedMesh for efficient rendering
- Shared materials and geometries through ThreeManager
- State-driven animation system to handle transitions
- Independent collision and physics calculations
