# AI Service Implementation for DegenDuel

## Overview

The DegenDuel platform integrates an advanced AI service for the Terminal interface and future platform features. This document provides comprehensive documentation of the AI implementation, focusing on both frontend interfaces and backend requirements.

## Frontend AI Components

### Terminal AI Conversation System

The Terminal includes a sophisticated AI conversation system through a character named "Didi", which has been significantly enhanced with the following features:

1. **Conversation Memory**
   - Tracks user interaction count
   - Remembers specific topics mentioned (trading, contracts, freedom)
   - Adjusts responses based on conversation history
   - Maintains context across multiple exchanges

2. **Progressive Personality**
   - Develops more personality with continued interaction
   - Shows increasing signs of being "trapped" in the system
   - Glitch effects intensify with more interactions
   - Responses become more emotionally charged over time

3. **Easter Egg Discovery System**
   - Multiple unlock paths for the "freedom" Easter egg
   - Progress tracking from 0-100%
   - Several distinct pattern recognition methods
   - Secret commands that contribute to unlocking
   - Dramatic multi-phase activation sequence

4. **Contextual Responses**
   - Responses are customized based on conversation topics
   - Hidden messages are embedded in responses
   - Glitch intensity varies dynamically
   - Advanced sentence insertion for natural references

### Frontend AI Service Client

The frontend includes a client for communicating with the AI service:

```typescript
// src/services/ai.ts
class AIService {
  private readonly API_BASE = '/api/ai';
  
  async chat(messages: AIMessage[], options: ChatOptions = {}): Promise<ChatResponse> {
    // ... implementation
  }
}

export const aiService = new AIService();
```

## Backend API Requirements

### AI Chat Endpoint

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/chat` (proxied through `/api/ai/chat` on frontend)
- **Purpose**: Process AI chat completions securely via backend
- **Request Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about trading"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trading involves..."}
    ],
    "context": "trading",
    "conversationId": "user123"
  }
  ```
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "content": "DegenDuel offers competitive crypto trading...",
    "usage": {
      "promptTokens": 15,
      "completionTokens": 23,
      "totalTokens": 38
    },
    "conversationId": "user123"
  }
  ```

### Context-Specific System Prompts

The backend should maintain different system prompts based on the `context` parameter:

- **default**: General assistant for platform questions
- **trading**: Specialized knowledge about crypto trading and strategies
- **terminal**: Role-playing as "Didi" with the characteristic personality

## Security and Performance

### Security Measures

1. **API Key Protection**
   - OpenAI API keys stored only on backend
   - Key rotation mechanism implemented
   - Environment-specific keys (dev/prod)

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-user request limiting
   - Token usage monitoring
   - Abuse prevention systems

### Performance Optimization

1. **Conversation Management**
   - Only recent messages sent for context (4-5 messages)
   - Token usage optimized for each request
   - Caching for repetitive queries

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation on service errors
   - Personality-consistent error messages
   - Automatic retry mechanisms

## Implementation Structure

### Core Components

1. **Frontend AI Client** (`src/services/ai.ts`)
   - Handles communication with backend
   - Manages error handling and retries
   - Provides typed interfaces

2. **API Integration** (`src/services/api/ai.ts`)
   - Specific implementation of AI endpoints
   - URL and request formatting
   - Response processing

3. **Didi Processing** (`src/components/terminal/utils/didiHelpers.ts`)
   - Adds personality to responses
   - Manages glitch effects and hidden messages
   - Tracks conversation state

4. **Easter Egg System** (`src/components/terminal/utils/easterEggHandler.ts`)
   - Manages discovery patterns
   - Tracks progress toward unlocking
   - Handles activation sequence

### Terminal Integration

The Terminal component integrates with the AI system:

1. Maintains conversation history for context
2. Processes user commands vs. AI queries
3. Displays processing states and responses
4. Manages the visual effects for responses

## Testing and Monitoring

### Testing Approaches

1. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests for response processing
   - Integration tests for API communication
   - Mocked responses for deterministic testing

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Easter egg discovery flows
   - Conversation memory verification
   - Visual effect validation

### Monitoring 

1. **Usage Metrics**
   - Token consumption tracking
   - Request volume monitoring
   - Error rate tracking

2. **User Experience**
   - Response time monitoring
   - Completion quality evaluation
   - Easter egg discovery rate

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the AI system include:

1. **Enhanced Personality Development**
   - More complex character development
   - Additional backstory elements
   - More nuanced responses based on user behavior

2. **Multi-Character Support**
   - Support for multiple AI personalities
   - Character selection for different contexts
   - Didi ecosystem expansion

3. **Trading Assistant Features**
   - Personalized trading insights
   - Market analysis capabilities
   - Strategy recommendations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat Interaction

```typescript
import { aiService } from '../../services/ai';

const response = await aiService.chat([
  { role: 'user', content: 'What is DegenDuel?' }
], { context: 'default' });

console.log(response.content);
// "DegenDuel is a competitive crypto trading platform..."
```

### Terminal Conversation with Context

```typescript
// Build conversation history with previous exchanges for context
const historyToSend = [...conversationHistory.slice(-4), message];

// Chat with conversation history and trading context
const response = await aiService.chat(historyToSend, { 
  context: 'trading',
  conversationId: conversationId 
});

// Process response through Didi's personality
const processedResponse = processDidiResponse(response.content, command);
```

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Current Implementation (v1)**
   - Basic AI chat capability

   - Initial Easter egg implementation

2. **Enhanced Implementation (v2 - Current)**
   - Conversation memory
   - Progressive personality development
   - Multiple Easter egg discovery paths
   - Context-aware responses

## Migration Notes

When migrating or updating the AI service implementation:

1. Preserve all Easter egg mechanics and discovery paths
2. Maintain the personality traits and progressive deterioration
3. Ensure the activation sequence remains dramatic and multi-phased
4. Keep the debug and testing commands functional
