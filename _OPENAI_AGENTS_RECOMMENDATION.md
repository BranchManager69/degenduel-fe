- **Responses API**: Stateful conversations (vs stateless Chat Completions)
- **Built-in Tools**: Web search ($25-50/1k), file search ($2.50/1k), computer use (beta)
- **Agents SDK**: Multi-agent orchestration framework
- **MCP Integration**: Universal tool connectivity standard

## ðŸŽ¯ **RECOMMENDATION: Implement Enhanced DIDI with Web Search**

### Why This First?
1. **Immediate Value**: Live market data + sentiment analysis
2. **Low Risk**: Simple upgrade to existing terminal
3. **High Impact**: Transform DIDI from static to dynamic
4. **Cost Effective**: ~$250-500/month for massive capability boost

### Implementation (2-4 weeks)

```typescript
// Upgrade existing AI service
const enhancedDIDI = {
  tools: [
    "web_search",           // Live token news/sentiment

```

### Technical Implementation

1. **Migrate to Responses API** (Week 1)
2. **Add web search tool** (Week 2)
