# DegenDuel WebSocket System Overhaul

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the comprehensive WebSocket system overhaul for DegenDuel. The new implementation provides enhanced security, better connection management, and improved performance monitoring.

## Current Implementation Status

### Authentication Flow

The WebSocket authentication system follows a two-stage process:

1. **Session Authentication (Existing)**
   - User authenticates with their wallet via `/api/auth/verify-wallet`
   - Server sets an HTTP-only cookie with the main JWT session token
   - Session lasts for 24 hours

2. **WebSocket Token Generation (New)**
   - Frontend calls `/api/auth/token` before establishing WebSocket connections
   - This endpoint verifies the session cookie is valid
   - Generates a WebSocket-specific JWT token with a 1-hour expiration
   - Returns the token to the client

3. **WebSocket Connection**
   - Client uses the WebSocket-specific token when connecting
   - Token is sent either in the protocol header or URL parameter
   - WebSocket server validates this token before allowing connections

### Detailed Implementation Examples

#### Token Endpoint Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @swagger
 * /api/auth/token:
 *   get:
 *     summary: Get current access token for WebSocket connections
 *     tags: [Authentication]
 *     security:
 *       - cookieAuth: []
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: Token provided successfully
 *       401:
 *         description: No valid session
 */
router.get('/token', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const sessionToken = req.cookies.session;
    if (!sessionToken) {
      authLogger.debug('No session token provided for token request');
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No session token provided' });
    }

    const decoded = jwt.verify(sessionToken, config.jwt.secret);
    
    const user = await prisma.users.findUnique({
      where: { wallet_address: decoded.wallet_address }
    });

    if (!user) {
      authLogger.debug('User not found for token request', { wallet: decoded.wallet_address });
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }

    // Create a WebSocket-specific token with shorter expiration
    const wsToken = sign(
      {
        wallet_address: user.wallet_address,
        role: user.role,
        session_id: decoded.session_id // Preserve the same session ID
      },
      config.jwt.secret,
      { expiresIn: '1h' } // Shorter expiration for WebSocket tokens
    );

    // Track token generation with analytics
    authLogger.analytics.trackInteraction(user, 'token_request', {
      success: true,
      session_id: decoded.session_id
    }, req.headers);

    authLogger.info('WebSocket token generated', { 
      wallet: user.wallet_address,
      session_id: decoded.session_id
    });

    return res.json({
      token: wsToken,
      expiresIn: 3600 // 1 hour in seconds
    });

  } catch (error) {
    // Track failed token requests
    authLogger.analytics.trackInteraction(null, 'token_request', {
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    }, req.headers);

    authLogger.error('Token generation failed', { error: error.message });
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid session' });
  }
});
```

#### Client-Side Implementation Example

```javascript
// Example client implementation
async function getWebSocketToken() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/token');
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to get token');
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return {
      token: data.token,
      expiresAt: Date.now() + (data.expiresIn * 1000)
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting WebSocket token:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

async function connectToWebSocket(url) {
  // Get token first
  const { token } = await getWebSocketToken();
  
  // Connect with token
  const socket = new WebSocket(`${url}?token=${token}`);
  
  // Handle connection events
  socket.onopen = () => console.log('WebSocket connected');
  socket.onerror = (error) => console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
  
  return socket;
}
```

#### Client-Side Feature Flag Support

```javascript
// In frontend code
const useWebSocketV2 = getFeatureFlag('use_websocket_v2');

// Connection helper that tries v2 first, falls back to v1
function connectToMonitor() {
  if (useWebSocketV2) {
    try {
      const v2Connection = new WebSocket('wss://degenduel.me/api/v2/ws/monitor');

      // If connection fails, fall back to v1
      v2Connection.onerror = () => {
        console.log('Falling back to v1 WebSocket');
        connectToMonitorV1();
      };

      return v2Connection;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error with v2 WebSocket, falling back to v1', error);
      return connectToMonitorV1();
    }
  } else {
    return connectToMonitorV1();
  }
}

function connectToMonitorV1() {
  return new WebSocket('wss://degenduel.me/api/ws/monitor');
}
```

### WebSocket Server Authentication

The server validates tokens by:

1. Extracting the token from the protocol header or URL query parameter
2. Verifying the token using JWT
3. Validating that the user exists in the database
4. Storing user information in the connection context

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Lifetime**: WebSocket tokens have a shorter lifetime (1 hour) than session tokens (24 hours)
2. **Separate Tokens**: Using dedicated WebSocket tokens rather than session tokens
3. **Token Rotation**: Clients should implement token refresh before expiration

### Troubleshooting

If WebSocket connections fail:

1. Check that the client is correctly calling `/api/auth/token` before connecting
2. Verify the token is being passed correctly in the WebSocket connection
3. Check server logs for authentication failures
4. Ensure the token hasn't expired

### Implementation Strategy

We're using a non-destructive parallel implementation approach:

1. **Create Parallel Files Structure**
   - New directory: `/websocket/v2/` for all new implementations
   - Existing WebSockets remain untouched in `/websocket/`

2. **Implement Base Class First**
   - Create `/websocket/v2/base-websocket-v2.js` with all enhancements
   - Test thoroughly in isolation

3. **Parallel Implementation of WebSockets**
   - Create `/websocket/v2/monitor-ws-v2.js` using the new base class
   - Mount at different endpoints (e.g., `/api/v2/ws/monitor`)
   - Both old and new implementations run simultaneously

4. **Gradual Client-Side Integration**
   - Feature flag system in frontend
   - Dual connection capability with fallback to old system if needed

5. **Testing Without Breaking Changes**
   - Test with specific test accounts/browsers
   - Add telemetry to compare performance and reliability

6. **Rollback Plan**
   - Disable v2 endpoints if issues arise
   - No changes to production code until fully validated

7. **Final Cutover**
   - Update main endpoints to use v2 implementations
   - Keep old implementations as fallbacks for 1-2 weeks

### Latest Development: v69 Base WebSocket Class

A comprehensive v69 base WebSocket class has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Authentication System**

     - Advanced authentication with JWT validation
     - Channel-based subscription management
     - Connection lifecycle management
     - Performance metrics
     - Security protections

2. **First v69 WebSocket Server Implementation**
   - Implemented `/websocket/v69/monitor-ws.js` that:
     - Handles system status updates
     - Tracks maintenance mode
     - Provides system settings (including the public background_scene)
     - Supports service monitoring
     - Follows the parallel implementation pattern

3. **WebSocket Initializer**
   - Created `/websocket/v69/websocket-initializer.js` that:
     - Sets up all v69 WebSockets

## Issues and Challenges

### Portfolio and Token Data WebSocket Overlap

There is significant functional overlap between the planned Portfolio WebSocket and Token Data WebSocket:

- **Token Data** provides real-time market data (prices, metadata, etc.)
- **Portfolio** applies this data to user holdings for valuation

This creates potential inefficiencies:
1. Duplicate data streams if implemented separately
2. Synchronization challenges between services
3. Additional overhead for clients connecting to both

**Potential solutions:**
- Consolidate into a single WebSocket with distinct channels
- Create a tiered system where Portfolio subscribes to Token Data internally
- Implement as separate services but with shared underlying data provider

The final architecture will depend on performance testing and server readiness for token data streaming. This evaluation is scheduled after the core WebSockets are implemented.

### Server Infrastructure Readiness

Some WebSocket implementations (particularly Token Data) require:

1. Optimized background data aggregation systems
2. Efficient caching layers
3. Market data provider stability

These infrastructure components are still being prepared, which may affect implementation order and timeline.

### Migration Strategy from Legacy WebSockets

A comprehensive strategy is needed to migrate clients from the existing WebSocket system to v69:

1. Feature flags to control rollout to user segments
2. Backward compatibility support during transition
3. Fallback mechanisms if issues arise
4. Monitoring and observability during cutover
