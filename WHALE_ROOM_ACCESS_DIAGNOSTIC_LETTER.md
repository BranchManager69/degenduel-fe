# üêã WHALE ROOM ACCESS DIAGNOSTIC - Backend Investigation Required

**To:** Backend Development Team  
**From:** Frontend Team  
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Subject:** URGENT - Whale Room Token Gating Server-Side Verification Failure  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## üö® Issue Summary

**User Report:** User has 15M DUEL tokens (visible in header indicator) but cannot access Whale Room despite meeting the whale threshold.

**Root Cause Analysis:** Discrepancy between client-side token balance verification (working) and server-side whale status verification (failing).

---

## üîç Current System State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **Working Components (Client-Side)**
- Header balance indicator: Successfully shows `15,000,000 DUEL`
- Token balance fetching: RPC calls to Solana blockchain working
- User authentication: Wallet connected and authenticated
- Frontend whale room UI: Fully implemented and ready

### ‚ùå **Failing Components (Server-Side)**
- Whale status verification endpoint calls
- Server-side token balance checking
- Whale room access authorization

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Investigation Required

### **1. Endpoint Availability & Implementation Status**

**Questions for Backend Team:**

1. **Are the whale status endpoints implemented?**
   - `GET /api/user/whale-status`
   - `POST /api/user/whale-status/refresh`

2. **If implemented, what is their current status?**
   - Are they returning 404 (not found)?
   - Are they returning 500 (server error)?
   - Are they returning 200 but with error data?

3. **Can you provide the exact HTTP response codes and payloads** returned when these endpoints are called?

### **2. Database & User Object Investigation**

**Frontend expects this user object structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "user123",
  wallet_address: "ABC123...",
  degen_token_balance: 15000000,
  whale_status: true,
  last_balance_update: "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Questions:**
1. **Does the user object contain `degen_token_balance` and `whale_status` fields?**
2. **If not, are these fields in the database schema but not populated?**
3. **Are these fields missing entirely from the database schema?**
4. **What does the current user object look like for the affected user?**

### **3. Token Balance Verification System**

**Questions:**
1. **Do you have any server-side DUEL token balance checking implemented?**
2. **Are you making RPC calls to Solana from the backend?**
3. **What is the current whale threshold configured on the backend?**
4. **Is there any caching mechanism for token balances?**

### **4. Authentication & Authorization**

**Questions:**
1. **Are the whale status endpoints protected by authentication middleware?**
2. **Is the current user's session/JWT valid when calling these endpoints?**
3. **Can you confirm the user's `wallet_address` in your database matches what the frontend is sending?**

### **5. Error Logging & Debugging**

**Immediate Actions Requested:**
1. **Check server logs for whale status endpoint calls** from the affected user
2. **Provide exact error messages/stack traces** if any
3. **Test the endpoints manually** with the user's data
4. **Verify database connectivity** and token balance queries

---

## üîß Specific Testing Scenarios

### **Test Case 1: Manual Endpoint Testing**
Please test these endpoints manually for the affected user:

```bash
# Test GET endpoint
curl -X GET "${API_URL}/api/user/whale-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${USER_JWT}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Test POST refresh endpoint  
curl -X POST "${API_URL}/api/user/whale-status/refresh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${USER_JWT}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "is_whale": true,
    "current_balance": 15000000,
    "required_balance": 1000000,
    "balance_percentage": 1500.0,
    "whale_tier": "MEGA_WHALE",
    "last_updated": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### **Test Case 2: Database Query Verification**
Please run these database queries for the affected user:

```sql
-- Check user record
SELECT id, wallet_address, degen_token_balance, whale_status, last_balance_update 
FROM users 
WHERE wallet_address = 'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE';

-- Check if whale status fields exist
DESCRIBE users;
-- or
PRAGMA table_info(users);
```

### **Test Case 3: RPC Connection Testing**
If you have Solana RPC integration:

```javascript
// Test token balance fetch for user's wallet
const tokenBalance = await connection.getTokenAccountsByOwner(
  new PublicKey(userWalletAddress),
  { mint: new PublicKey(DUEL_TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS) }
);
```
