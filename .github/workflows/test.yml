name: DegenDuel CI/CD

# This workflow handles testing, building, and deployment verification for the DegenDuel frontend
# It creates the necessary deployment records for GitHub branch protection requirements
# Main flow: test -> build-dev -> build-prod -> performance monitoring
# 
# IMPORTANT: GitHub environment names must be EXACTLY:
#   - "development (dev.degenduel.me)" - for development environment
#   - "production (degenduel.me)" - for production environment
# These exact names are required by branch protection rules
#
# Additional jobs:
# - specialized-builds: For preview builds with experimental features
# - visual-regression: Visual regression testing for PRs
# - storybook: Builds component documentation when available
#
# Note: Actual deployment to dev and production servers is handled outside this workflow
# This workflow only creates the GitHub deployment records required for branch protection
