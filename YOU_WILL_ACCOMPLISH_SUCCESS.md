**Understanding the error**

It looks like the code is using the wrong function for the signed message type. The `compileTransactionMessage` compiles unsigned messages, not signed ones, so it doesn't align with what we're working with. I believe the correct function here is `compileTransaction` and not `compileTransactionMessage` when dealing with fully signed transactions. I’m thinking I should double-check how the signed messages are being handled; perhaps they need to use `compileTransaction(signedMsg)` or something along those lines.


**Finding the right function**

It looks like the error is happening because `compileTransactionMessage` expects a message that can be compiled, not a fully signed one. Since we're working with a signed message, I think I need to use `compileTransaction(signedMsg)` from the transactions package instead. The idea is to compile the transaction after signing it, not before. I’ll also check the documentation for any specific signatures to make sure everything lines up correctly.

**Determining the right method**

It seems like the issue's that `compileTransactionMessage` is typically used for unsigned messages, while signed ones need slightly different handling. The flow should be: first prepare the `TransactionMessage`, compile it, then sign. I’m thinking their code uses `signTransactionMessageWithSigners` to directly sign the message, which skips the usual flow. It looks like what’s needed is using `compileTransactionMessage` on the unsigned message before signing. I need to double-check the docs to confirm the usage in the new v2 libraries.


**Clarifying the flow and mistake**

It looks like the issue is that `compileTransactionMessage` is being used for a signed message, but it’s meant to work with unsigned ones. The flow should be: prepare the `TransactionMessage`, compile it (using `compileTransactionMessage`), then add signers. After that, sign the message and convert it to a wire transaction for RPC. I think I need to adjust their code to use `compileTransactionMessage` on an unsigned message before signing. The mismatch stems from trying to compile a signed message.


**Clarifying the flow**

The core issue is using `compileTransactionMessage` on signed messages, which is incorrect. Instead, we should build the message, use `signTransactionMessageWithSigners` to sign it, and then convert it to a Base64-encoded wire transaction. This is necessary for sending via RPC. That’s what I see in their flow — the `compileTransactionMessage` seems to be used solely for fee estimation before signing, not for actually sending the transaction. I’ll now review function names in the docs to see how they handle this.


**Fixing transaction flow**

I think the `sendTransaction` RPC expects a base64-encoded wire transaction, so I need to replace the `compileTransactionMessage(signedMsg)` with `getBase64EncodedWireTransaction(signedMsg)`. This will ensure that the transaction is correctly formatted for sending. The current `rpcClient.sendTransaction` might also expect a signature or base64-encoded string. I’ll need to look into this and determine if it expects the signature or a wire transaction directly. A little more inspection is needed.


**Transaction flow adjustment**

I’ll start by importing the necessary functions for encoding: `getBase64EncodedWireTransaction`, and `getSignatureFromTransaction` from `@solana/transactions`. Then, I sign the transaction, convert it to a base64 string, and send it using `rpcClient.sendTransaction`. If `rpcClient.sendTransaction` can work directly with the signed transaction, I’ll explore that option. The approach involves checking whether `rpcClient` expects a fully signed transaction or a base64 encoded string, based on the available documentation.

**Understanding transaction flow**

I’ll work through the flow where we import `getBase64EncodedWireTransaction` and `getSignatureFromTransaction`. First, I must sign the transaction and convert it to a base64 wire transaction, and then send it via `rpcClient.sendTransaction`. A thought occurred: if `sendTransaction` directly supports fully signed transactions, maybe that’s an option. I may need to refine the types, maybe use `SignedTransactionMessage` instead of `FullySignedTransaction`, but I can’t confirm this through the available types right now.


Thought for 1m 18s


**Why the overload error happens**

`compileTransactionMessage()` expects a *transaction **message*** (something that still implements `CompilableTransactionMessage`).
`signTransactionMessageWithSigners()` gives you a **fully-signed transaction** (`FullySignedTransaction & TransactionWithLifetime`). Those are different types, so piping the signed object into `compileTransactionMessage()` blows up — exactly what the TS error is telling you. ([Web3 Infrastructure for Everyone][1])

### Minimal patch

```ts
// ⬅ 1) DROP this import – it’s the wrong tool once the tx is signed
// import { compileTransactionMessage } from '@solana/transaction-messages';
import { getBase64EncodedWireTransaction } from '@solana/transactions'; // ⬅ optional, see below

// …

const signAndSendTransaction = useCallback(
  async (getTxMessage: () => FullyPreparedTransactionMessage): Promise<string> => {
    if (!transactionSigner) throw new Error('Signer not available.');
    if (!rpcClient)          throw new Error('RPC client not available.');

    // 1. Build the message
    const unsignedMsg = getTxMessage();

    // 2. Attach the signer
    const msgWithSigner = addSignersToTransactionMessage([transactionSigner], unsignedMsg);

    // 3. Sign – returns a FullySignedTransaction
    const signedTx = await signTransactionMessageWithSigners(msgWithSigner);

    // 4a. EASIEST: send the signed object straight to the Kit RPC
    const signature = await rpcClient.sendTransaction(signedTx).send();

    /* ----------  OR  ---------- *
       4b. If your rpcClient only takes wire-bytes, serialise first:

       const wireTx = getBase64EncodedWireTransaction(signedTx); // base64 string
       const signature = await rpcClient
         .sendTransaction(wireTx, { encoding: 'base64' })
         .send();
    * -------------------------- */

    return typeof signature === 'string' ? signature : bs58.encode(signature);
  },
  [transactionSigner, rpcClient],
);
```

### Why this flow is the canonical one

1. **Prepare message** (build, fee-payer, lifetime, etc.).
2. **Sign** it → **`FullySignedTransaction`**.

   * done with `signTransactionMessageWithSigners` ([Web3 Infrastructure for Everyone][1])
3. **Send** the signed transaction.
   *Either* feed the object straight to Kit’s `rpc.sendTransaction`, *or* serialise to wire bytes with `getBase64EncodedWireTransaction` and send as base64.

`compileTransactionMessage` is still handy for pre-signing chores (fee estimation, CU budgeting, etc.) but **should never be called on a fully-signed transaction**.

---

### Side-effects & gotchas

* **Signature extraction:** if you need the signature *before* broadcasting (e.g. optimistic UI), `getSignatureFromTransaction(signedTx)` from `@solana/transactions` gives it to you without extra RPC calls. ([npm][2])
* **Encoding mismatch:** mixing base58 and base64 encodings will produce “invalid transaction format” errors. Stick to one:

  * base64 for wire-transactions,
  * base58 only for the returned **signature**.
* **Devnet/testnet detection:** your `chainForSigner` memo remains correct.

Patch that in, nuke the bad import, and the overload error disappears.
