# Notifications Debug Summary

## Debug Steps Implemented

1. **Added comprehensive logging to useNotifications hook**:
   - Logs all incoming WebSocket messages
   - Logs WebSocket connection state changes
   - Logs when notifications are received and processed

2. **Enhanced NotificationsDropdown component logging**:
   - Logs component state including notification count, loading state, and connection status

3. **Created NotificationDebugPanel component**:
   - Visual debug panel accessible with Ctrl+Shift+N
   - Shows real-time WebSocket connection status
   - Displays notification statistics
   - Shows recent WebSocket messages
   - Has a "Refresh Notifications" button for testing

## Key Components Checked

1. **useNotifications hook** (`src/hooks/websocket/topic-hooks/useNotifications.ts`):
   - Subscribes to the 'user' topic
   - Sends `GET_NOTIFICATIONS` request when connected
   - Handles various notification actions (NOTIFICATIONS_LIST, NEW_NOTIFICATION, etc.)

2. **NotificationsDropdown** (`src/components/layout/menu/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`):
   - Uses the useNotifications hook
   - Displays notification count and list
   - Shows in Header component

3. **NotificationsPage** (`src/pages/authenticated/NotificationsPage.tsx`):
   - Full page view of all notifications
   - Also uses the useNotifications hook

4. **Header** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`):
   - Renders UserMenu with unreadNotifications prop
   - UserMenu renders NotificationsDropdown

## What to Check Next

1. **Open the browser console** and look for logs starting with:
   - `[useNotifications]` - These show WebSocket state and message processing
   - `[NotificationsDropdown]` - Shows component state

2. **Press Ctrl+Shift+N** to open the debug panel and check:
   - Is WebSocket connected?
   - Is user authenticated?
   - Are any WebSocket messages being received?
   - What happens when you click "Refresh Notifications"?

3. **Backend verification needed**:
   - Is the backend sending notifications for the 'user' topic?
   - Is authentication working properly for the WebSocket connection?
   - Are there any notifications in the database for the test user?

## Possible Issues

1. **Authentication**: The 'user' topic requires authentication. Check if the WebSocket is properly authenticated.

2. **No data**: The backend might not have any notifications to send.

3. **Wrong action/topic**: The backend might be using different action names or topic structures.

4. **Timing**: The request might be sent before the WebSocket is fully authenticated.

## Testing Steps

1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer console
3. Navigate to a page that shows notifications (header dropdown or /notifications page)
4. Check console logs for WebSocket connection status
5. Press Ctrl+Shift+N to open debug panel
6. Click "Refresh Notifications" button in debug panel
7. Check if any messages appear in the debug panel

## Next Actions

Based on what you see in the console logs and debug panel, we can:
- Add more specific logging
- Check backend API endpoints directly
- Verify authentication flow
- Test with different WebSocket topics/actions
