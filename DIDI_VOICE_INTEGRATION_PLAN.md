## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Frontend Implementation (Web-Based)**

#### **1. Web Speech API Integration**
```typescript
// Voice input using Web Speech API
interface VoiceInputManager {
  recognition: SpeechRecognition;
  synthesis: SpeechSynthesis;
  isListening: boolean;
  isSupported: boolean;
}

class DidiVoiceManager {
  private recognition: SpeechRecognition;
  private synthesis: SpeechSynthesis;
  
  constructor() {
    // Modern browser support
    this.recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
    this.synthesis = window.speechSynthesis;
    
    // Configuration
    this.recognition.continuous = false;
    this.recognition.interimResults = true;
    this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';
  }
  
  startListening(): Promise<string> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.recognition.onresult = (event) => {
        const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
        resolve(transcript);
      };
      
      this.recognition.onerror = (event) => {
        reject(event.error);
      };
      
      this.recognition.start();
    });
  }
  
  speak(text: string, voice?: string): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
      utterance.voice = this.getVoice(voice);
      utterance.onend = () => resolve();
      
      this.synthesis.speak(utterance);
    });
  }
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Terminal Voice UI**
```tsx
// Voice-enabled terminal input
const VoiceTerminalInput: React.FC = () => {
  const [isListening, setIsListening] = useState(false);
  const [transcript, setTranscript] = useState('');
  const [voiceEnabled, setVoiceEnabled] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="terminal-input-container">
      {/* Regular text input */}
      <textarea value={userInput} onChange={handleTextInput} />
      
      {/* Voice input button */}
      <motion.button
        className={`voice-button ${isListening ? 'listening' : ''}`}
        onMouseDown={startVoiceInput}
        onMouseUp={stopVoiceInput}
        onTouchStart={startVoiceInput}
        onTouchEnd={stopVoiceInput}
        whilePressed={{ scale: 1.1 }}
      >
        {isListening ? <MicActiveIcon /> : <MicIcon />}
      </motion.button>
      
      {/* Voice transcript preview */}
      {transcript && (
        <div className="voice-transcript">
          <span className="transcript-text">"{transcript}"</span>
          <button onClick={sendVoiceCommand}>Send</button>
        </div>
      )}
      
      {/* Voice response indicator */}
      {didiSpeaking && (
        <div className="didi-speaking">
          <WaveformAnimation />
          <span>Didi is speaking...</span>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Backend Integration (Inspired by OpenAI Cookbook)**

#### **1. Voice-Aware AI Service**
```javascript
// Enhanced AI service with voice capabilities
class DidiVoiceService {
  constructor() {
    this.voiceWorkflow = new VoiceWorkflow({
      agent: didiAgent,
      speechModel: "tts-1-hd",
      voicePreset: "nova", // Female voice for Didi
      responseFormat: "both" // Text + Audio
    });
  }
  
  async processVoiceInput(audioBuffer, context) {
    try {
      // Convert voice to text
      const transcript = await this.speechToText(audioBuffer);
      
      // Process through existing AI pipeline with voice context
      const response = await this.processCommand(transcript, {
        ...context,
        inputMode: 'voice',
        outputMode: 'voice_and_text',
        personality: 'conversational'
      });
      
      // Generate voice response
      const audioResponse = await this.textToSpeech(response.content);
      
      return {
        text: response.content,
        audio: audioResponse,
        ui_actions: response.ui_actions,
        voice_instructions: this.generateVoiceInstructions(response)
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return this.handleVoiceError(error);
    }
  }
  
  generateVoiceInstructions(response) {
    // Convert UI actions to voice descriptions
    if (response.ui_actions?.component === 'TokenCard') {
      return "I'm showing you the token data on screen now.";
    }
    if (response.ui_actions?.component === 'PriceChart') {
      return "Take a look at the price chart I've generated for you.";
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

#### **2. Voice-Optimized System Prompts**
```javascript
const VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are Didi, DegenDuel's AI assistant. You're responding to voice input, so:

VOICE RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
- Speak naturally and conversationally
- Keep responses concise but informative (30-60 seconds max)
- Use numbers clearly: "one hundred forty-two dollars and fifty cents" not "$142.50"
- Guide user attention: "I'm showing you the data on screen" when providing visuals
- Ask follow-up questions to keep conversation flowing
- Use friendly, encouraging tone for trading decisions

VOICE-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- User is speaking to you, so respond as if in conversation
- They may be multitasking (driving, walking, working)
- Prioritize audio response, use visuals as supplement
- Be proactive with suggestions: "Would you like me to..." 

TRADING VOICE COMMANDS:
- Price checks: Speak current price + context
- Portfolio: Summarize performance and key positions
- Contests: Explain status and next steps clearly
- Analysis: Break down complex data into digestible spoken insights
`;
```

### **3. Multi-Modal Response System**
```typescript
interface VoiceResponse {
  text: string;           // Markdown for terminal display
  audio: Blob;           // Generated speech audio
  ui_actions: UIAction[]; // Visual components
  voice_cues: string[];   // "Look at the chart I'm showing you"
  pause_points: number[]; // Where to pause speech for visual elements
}

// Voice response processor
class VoiceResponseProcessor {
  async processResponse(response: VoiceResponse) {
    // 1. Start playing audio response
    const audioPromise = this.playAudio(response.audio);
    
    // 2. Display text and UI components simultaneously
    this.displayTextResponse(response.text);
    this.renderUIActions(response.ui_actions);
    
    // 3. Handle pause points for visual elements
    this.handleVoiceCues(response.voice_cues, response.pause_points);
    
    await audioPromise;
  }
  
  private async handleVoiceCues(cues: string[], pausePoints: number[]) {
    // Pause speech at specific points to let user see visuals
    pausePoints.forEach((point, index) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (cues[index]) {
          this.highlightVisualElement(cues[index]);
        }
      }, point * 1000);
    });
  }
}
```

## üì± Platform-Specific Implementation

### **Web Browser (Primary)**
- **Web Speech API** for voice recognition
- **Speech Synthesis API** for responses
- **MediaRecorder API** for high-quality audio capture
- **WebRTC** for real-time processing
- **Progressive enhancement** - graceful fallback to text

### **Mobile Optimizations**
```typescript
// Mobile-specific voice handling
const MobileVoiceAdapter = {
  // iOS Safari specific fixes
  iosAudioContext: new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)(),
  
  // Android Chrome optimizations
  androidPermissions: async () => {
    await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
  },
  
  // Touch-optimized voice button
  handleTouchVoice: (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent zoom on double-tap
    this.startVoiceCapture();
  }
};
```

### **Desktop Enhancements**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Space to talk, Escape to cancel)
- **Multiple microphone support**
- **Background voice activation** (when terminal is focused)
- **System notification integration**

---

## üéØ Voice Command Categories

### **1. Quick Price Checks**
```
Voice: "What's SOL trading at?"
Didi: "Solana is currently one hundred forty-two dollars and thirty cents, up three point two percent today. That's a nice gain from yesterday's close."
```

### **2. Portfolio Management**
```
Voice: "How's my portfolio doing?"
Didi: "Your portfolio is up eight percent today, currently valued at three thousand two hundred dollars. Your best performer is SOL with a twelve percent gain. I'm showing your portfolio breakdown on screen."
```

### **3. Contest Interaction**
```
Voice: "Join me in contest 123"
Didi: "Contest 123 is the 'SOL vs ETH Battle' ending in four hours. Entry fee is fifty dollars. I'm opening the contest page for you - would you like me to explain the rules?"
```

### **4. Advanced Analysis**
```
Voice: "Should I buy more BONK?"
Didi: "BONK is down fifteen percent this week but showing support at current levels. Based on your portfolio, you're already allocated ten percent to meme coins. I'd suggest waiting for a clearer trend. Want me to set a price alert?"
```
