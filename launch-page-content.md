## Introduction
The DUEL token is launching with improved tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability. New participants can join via the Jupiter Studio bonding curve or Meteora liquidity pool, while legacy holders can migrate their tokens at a 1:0.5 ratio. This launch prioritizes fair distribution, community alignment, and a powerful flywheel over centralization, insiders, or bags for Evelyn.

We're excited to build alongside Jupiter, the trading infrastructure that powers Solana. Their platform has fundamentally shaped how trading works on-chain, and their launch tools provide the fair distribution model that aligns with our vision.
