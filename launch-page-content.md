## Introduction
The DUEL token is launching with improved tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability. New participants can join via the Jupiter Studio bonding curve or Meteora liquidity pool, while legacy holders can migrate their tokens at a 1:0.5 ratio. This launch prioritizes fair distribution, community alignment, and a powerful flywheel over centralization, insiders, or bags for Evelyn.

We're excited to build alongside Jupiter, the trading infrastructure that powers Solana. Their platform has fundamentally shaped how trading works on-chain, and their launch tools provide the fair distribution model that aligns with our vision.

**Key Formulas**:
- Required SOL = $17,500 / Current_SOL_Price
- Bonding% = 100% - Vested% - Migrating%
- Efficiency â‰ˆ 0.31 - (0.004 Ã— Bonding%)
- Grad_MC = Initial_MC + (Required_SOL / (Bonding% Ã— Efficiency))
- Public_Entry_MC = Initial_MC + (Vested% Ã— (Grad_MC - Initial_MC))

- Vested: 75% | Bonding: 19.9% | Migrating: 5.1%
- Initial MC: 137.5 SOL

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/admin/ai-analysis/summary
```

## Query Parameters

- `detailed` (boolean): Include full recent analyses for each type (default: false)
- `recent` (number): Number of recent analyses to include when detailed=true (default: 3)

## Examples

### Basic Summary
```bash
GET /api/admin/ai-analysis/summary
```

Returns overview with counts, latest analysis previews, and cost breakdown.

### Detailed Summary with 5 Recent Analyses
```bash
GET /api/admin/ai-analysis/summary?detailed=true&recent=5
```

Returns everything from basic summary PLUS full content of the 5 most recent analyses for each type.

## Cost Calculation Explained

The estimated costs are based on typical token usage patterns:

| Analysis Type | Avg Tokens | Cost per Analysis | Calculation |

        }
      ]
    },
    // Similar for admin_actions, general_logs, service_logs
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Use basic summary for high-level metrics
2. **Detailed Reporting**: Use detailed=true for comprehensive reports
3. **Recent Activity**: Use detailed=true&recent=10 for last 10 of each type
4. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor AI usage costs with the cost_breakdown

## Integration Example

```javascript
// Frontend integration
async function getAIAnalysisDashboard() {
  // Basic overview for dashboard
  const overview = await fetch('/api/admin/ai-analysis/summary');
  
  // Detailed view for reports
  const detailed = await fetch('/api/admin/ai-analysis/summary?detailed=true&recent=5');
  
  return { overview, detailed };
}
```

## Benefits of Single Endpoint

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Get all analysis data in one request
2. **Flexible Detail Level**: Choose between overview and full details
3. **Performance**: Optimized queries with parallel data fetching
4. **Cost Visibility**: Transparent AI usage costs with breakdown
5. **Service Insights**: See which services generate most AI analyses

This single endpoint replaces the need to call 4+ separate endpoints for a complete view of AI analysis activity.
