It looks like your console is getting hammered by a few key issues, which are generating a massive number of log entries. Let's break down the main culprits:

1.  **Minified React Error #185**:
    *   You're seeing this error repeatedly: `Error: Minified React error #185; visit https://react.dev/errors/185 for the full message...`
    *   This error typically means your application is trying to perform an action (like updating state or accessing a DOM node) on a component that has already been unmounted from the screen. The React documentation link provided in the error is the best place to start for a full explanation.
    *   **Why it's spammy**: Each occurrence throws a long stack trace, and it's happening in several places, including `BackgroundEffectsBoundary` and `AppErrorBoundary` (which might be trying to handle errors in child components like `Header`). The stack traces often end with `performWorkUntilDeadline @ scheduler.production.js:151`.
    *   **What to look for**: Check `useEffect` hooks in your components. If they set up subscriptions (e.g., to WebSockets, event listeners) or initiate asynchronous operations (like data fetching), they **must** have a cleanup function that cancels these subscriptions or tasks when the component unmounts. For example:
        ```javascript
        useEffect(() => {
          const subscription = someService.subscribe(data => {
            // Update state
          });
          return () => {
            subscription.unsubscribe(); // Cleanup!
          };
        }, []);
        ```
        Given the other errors, this could be triggered if components are unmounting due to WebSocket or API data failures.

2.  **WebSocket Connection Failures**:
    *   There are numerous logs related to WebSocket connection problems with `wss://dev.degenduel.me/api/v69/ws`:
        *   `[WebSocket:system] [Error] ... Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error', ...}`
        *   `[WebSocket:system] [Closed] [/api/v69/ws] [Code: 1006] [Reason: No reason provided]` (Code 1006 indicates an abnormal closure)
        *   `[WSMonitor] WebSocket system suspended due to: Multiple 1006 (abnormal closure) errors`
    *   **Why it's spammy**: The system tries to connect, fails, logs the error, and this cycle repeats until the `WSMonitor` gives up. Consequently, many components that depend on this WebSocket (like `notifications-hook`, `system-settings-hook`, `token-data-hook`, `terminal-data-hook`) are repeatedly logging messages like:
        *   `WebSocket: Component '...' registered but WebSocket not yet fully initialized`
        *   `[TerminalData WebSocket] Cannot refresh - WebSocket not connected`

3.  **API Call Failures (401 Unauthorized & 404 Not Found)**:
    *   **401 Unauthorized**:
        *   Calls to `/api/admin/maintenance/status` are failing with a 401, and the error body says `{"error":"No session token provided"}`. The application then retries this fetch multiple times (e.g., "Attempt 1/3", "Attempt 2/3", "Attempt 3/3"), each time logging the failure.
        *   Calls to `/admin/system-settings` are also failing with 401 Unauthorized.
    *   **404 Not Found**:
        *   The call to `https://dev.degenduel.me/api/v1/release-date` is resulting in a 404, causing the application to use a fallback release date.
    *   **Why it's spammy**: The repeated attempts and failures for the authenticated endpoints, especially `/api/admin/maintenance/status`, contribute significantly to the log noise.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate WebSocket Stability**: The `1006` errors for the WebSocket connection to `wss://dev.degenduel.me/api/v69/ws` are a primary concern. This could be a server-side issue, a network problem, or an issue with how the client is establishing the connection. Resolving this might reduce the React errors if they are caused by components reacting to connection loss.
2.  **Address Authentication for Admin APIs**: The `401 Unauthorized` errors for `/api/admin/maintenance/status` and `/admin/system-settings` indicate the frontend is making these requests without a valid session token. You'll need to ensure that authentication is correctly handled before these calls are made.
3.  **Tackle React Error #185**: Once the network and authentication issues are more stable, focus on the React error #185 by examining `useEffect` cleanup functions in components that perform async operations or subscriptions, particularly those that might be affected by WebSocket or API data streams. The components mentioned in the error boundaries (`BackgroundEffects`, `Header`) are good starting points.

The deprecation warnings (e.g., for `isAdmin()`, `isSuperAdmin()`, `createApiClient`) and the "No background_scene" warning are less critical for the immediate log spam but should be addressed for code health later.

Focusing on the WebSocket and API authentication issues might be the most effective first step, as these could be causing cascading failures leading to the React errors.
