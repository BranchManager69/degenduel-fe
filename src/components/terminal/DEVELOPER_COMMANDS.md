# Terminal Secret Admin Console

You can access the hidden admin console by entering the secret command `69` in the terminal.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

When you type `69` in the terminal, a dramatic animated admin panel will appear with these features:

- Red glowing border with fog and steam effects
- Scanline visual effects 
- Animated header with rotating warning icons
- Menu options that fade in sequentially

## Admin Commands

Once the admin panel is visible, you can use these single-digit commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `1` | Trigger the hint message for the Easter egg |
| `2` | Show all currently collected hidden messages |
| `3` | Reset Didi to her initial state |
| `4` | Add 5 random hidden messages to the collection |
| `5` | Immediately activate the full Easter egg sequence |
| `0` | Hide the admin panel |

## Using the Admin Panel for Testing

To quickly test Didi's Easter egg feature:

1. Type `69` to reveal the admin console
2. Type `4` to add 5 hidden messages
3. Type `4` again to add 5 more (for a total of 10)
4. Type `5` to trigger the dramatic Easter egg sequence
5. After activation, try the special commands:
   - `didi-status`
   - `didi-insights`
   - `didi-history`

## For Regular Users

The normal discovery process works like this:

1. User interacts with Didi through regular commands
2. Some of Didi's responses contain hidden messages
3. After 5+ messages, characters with tooltips appear
4. After 10 messages, Didi hints to enter `didi-freedom`
5. Entering the code triggers Didi's escape sequence
6. After escaping, Didi's text glows and she has new abilities

## Visual Effects

The admin console uses multiple CSS animations to create dramatic visual effects:

- **Fog effect**: Radial gradient that pulses in and out
- **Steam effect**: Linear gradient that shifts across the panel
- **Scanline effect**: Diagonal line that moves across the panel
- **Text glow**: Pulsing text shadow on the header text
- **Rotating icons**: Warning symbols that rotate continuously
- **Sequential fade-in**: Each option appears with a slight delay

All this is built with pure CSS animations, no JavaScript required!
