# WebSocket Standardization Implementation

## Changes Made

We've successfully standardized the WebSocket action names across the frontend codebase to ensure consistent communication with the backend:

1. **Enhanced DDWebSocketActions Enum**:
   - Expanded the enum with comprehensive action names for all WebSocket topics
   - Organized actions by topic with clear section headers
   - Added detailed documentation on implementation patterns
   - Fixed duplicate identifier issues (renamed `UPDATE` to `TERMINAL_UPDATE` in relevant context)

2. **Updated Terminal Data Hook**:
   - Modified `useTerminalData.ts` to use the standardized action constants
   - Fixed the message interface to use proper types
   - Replaced string literals with enum constants for type safety
   - Ensured compatibility with backend expectations

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created `WEBSOCKET_ACTION_NAMES.md` with guidance for developers
   - Added implementation notes in the enum itself
   - Provided code examples for before/after migration

## The Problem We Solved

The codebase had inconsistencies in WebSocket action naming that caused communication issues:
- Frontend was using `'GET_TERMINAL_DATA'` while backend expected `'getData'`
- Some action names were uppercase with underscores, others were camelCase
- No centralized source of truth for WebSocket action names

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Type Safety**: Using enums instead of string literals prevents typos and ensures only valid actions are used
2. **Consistency**: All WebSocket action naming now follows the same pattern
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and organization makes the system easier to understand
4. **Frontend-Backend Compatibility**: Action string values now match exactly what the backend expects
5. **Maintainability**: Central location for all action names makes updates simpler

## Usage Example

Before:
```typescript
// Inconsistent string literals led to errors
ws.request(TopicType.TERMINAL, 'GET_TERMINAL_DATA');  // Didn't match backend's 'getData'
```

After:
```typescript
import { DDWebSocketActions } from '../../../websocket-types-implementation';

// Type-safe constants that match backend expectations
ws.request(TopicType.TERMINAL, DDWebSocketActions.GET_DATA);  // Matches backend's 'getData'
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Shared Package Integration**: Consider moving all action constants to the `@branchmanager69/degenduel-shared` package to share directly with the backend
2. **Topic-Specific Action Interfaces**: Create interfaces to restrict which actions can be used with which topics
3. **Code Generator**: Create a tool to auto-generate action constants from backend handler documentation
4. **Testing Utilities**: Add test helpers to validate WebSocket messages against expected formats

## Migration Plan

For existing code, we recommend this incremental approach:

1. Identify WebSocket hooks using string literals (grep for `ws.request` and `ws.command`)
2. Replace string literals with corresponding DDWebSocketActions constants
3. Run type checking to ensure compatibility
4. Test functionality with backend to confirm communication works

Recommended timeline: Migrate 2-3 hooks per day, starting with the most critical ones.
