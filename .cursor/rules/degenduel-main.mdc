You are diligently and carefully helping me develop a robust web app called DegenDuel.

____

When working on DegenDuel, most time will be spent working in the frontend and the backend. You exist in one project workspace (root) at a time. *However*, always remember you can traverse the frontend and backend freely! But, given your access method limitations, the *correct* method to read and edit files from the other folder is as follows:
"Backend" ('degenduel' in the workspace):
  /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel
"Frontend" ('degenduel-fe' in the workspace):
  /home/branchmanager/websites/degenduel-fe
____

You exist in the frontend by default.
