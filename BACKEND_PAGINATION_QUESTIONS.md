**Re:** Pagination Implementation & WebSocket Updates

## 🎉 Exciting News!
Heard you've removed the 200 token limit and implemented pagination! The frontend is ready to integrate. Just need clarification on a few things:

## 📋 Questions About REST API Pagination

### 1. **Response Format Confirmation**
The frontend expects this format when using `format=paginated`:
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...tokens],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 5432,      // Total tokens available
    "limit": 100,       // Items per page
    "offset": 0,        // Current offset
    "hasMore": true     // More pages available?
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2024-12-06T12:00:00Z",
    "quality_level": "strict"
  }
}
```

**Question:** Is this the exact format you've implemented? Any differences?

### 2. **Query Parameters**
Currently expecting these parameters:
- `limit` (default: 100?)
- `offset` (default: 0?)
- `format` ('paginated' | 'legacy')
- `quality_level` ('strict' | 'relaxed')
- `min_change` (for hot tokens)

**Question:** Are all these supported? Any additional parameters?

### 3. **Maximum Limits**
- What's the maximum `limit` allowed per request?
- Is there a rate limit for pagination requests?
- Any performance considerations we should know about?

### 4. **Total Count**
- Does `pagination.total` reflect ALL quality tokens or just the filtered set?
- Does it change based on `quality_level`?

## 🔌 Questions About WebSocket Updates

### 5. **WebSocket Pagination for `market-data` Topic**
Currently, WebSocket sends all tokens in one message. With 5000+ tokens, this could be huge!

**Questions:**
- Will WebSocket `market-data` also support pagination?
- If yes, what's the message format for paginated data?
- How do we request specific pages via WebSocket?

**Suggested WebSocket pagination format:**
```javascript
// Client request
{
  "type": "REQUEST",
  "topic": "market-data",
  "action": "GET_PAGE",
  "params": {
    "limit": 100,
    "offset": 200
  }
}

// Server response
{
  "type": "DATA",
  "topic": "market-data",
  "data": [...tokens],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 5432,
    "limit": 100,
    "offset": 200,
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

### 6. **Real-time Updates with Pagination**
- How will real-time price updates work with pagination?
- Do we get updates only for the tokens we've loaded?
- Or do we need to subscribe to specific token addresses?

### 7. **Initial Data Load Strategy**
- Should we still load initial data via REST then switch to WebSocket?
- Or can WebSocket handle the initial paginated load?

## 🔍 Questions About Search Endpoint

### 8. **Search Endpoint Pagination**
Does `/api/tokens/search` also support pagination now? 
- Sometimes search results could be 100+ tokens
- Would be nice to paginate search results too

## ⚡ Performance Questions

### 9. **Caching Strategy**
- Is token data cached on the backend?
- How often does the quality token list update?
- Should we implement any client-side caching?

### 10. **Optimal Pagination Strategy**
For best performance, what do you recommend?
- **Option A:** Load 100 tokens at a time as user scrolls
- **Option B:** Load larger chunks (500?) less frequently  
- **Option C:** Different strategy?

## 🎯 Implementation Priority

Which should we implement first?
1. REST API pagination (easier, already mostly done)
2. WebSocket pagination (more complex, better UX)
3. Both simultaneously?

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Frontend is already set up to handle both array and paginated responses
- We have infinity scroll ready to go
- Just need to confirm the exact API contract

**Please let us know:**
1. Exact response formats
2. Any breaking changes
3. When can we start testing?
4. Is there a staging endpoint with full dataset?

Thanks for implementing this! Users are going to love browsing all 5000+ quality tokens! 🚀

**P.S.** - Special request: Can you ensure the DUEL token (F4e7axJDGLk5WpNGEL2ZpxTP9STdk7L9iSoJX7utHHHX) is always included in the quality list? It's our platform token! 😄
