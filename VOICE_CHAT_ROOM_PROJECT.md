# DegenDuel Voice Chat Room with Didi - Project Plan

## üéØ Vision
Create a revolutionary social AI voice chat experience where Didi (our AI) participates as a member of voice chat rooms alongside users. Think "Discord meets AI" but integrated into the DegenDuel terminal.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Concept: "Many-to-One-to-Many"
```
[Multiple Users] ‚Üí [Audio Mixer] ‚Üí [Single Stream] ‚Üí [OpenAI Realtime API]
                                                          ‚Üì
[All Users] ‚Üê [Broadcast] ‚Üê [Didi's Response] ‚Üê---------
```

**Key Insight**: OpenAI's Realtime API sees one conversation stream (the mixed room audio), making Didi a natural participant rather than managing multiple sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Infrastructure (Already Available)
- **Cloudflare**: WebSocket support, DDoS protection, global CDN
- **NGINX**: WebSocket proxy, load balancing, SSL termination
- **PM2**: Process management for media server
- **32GB RAM Server**: More than sufficient for audio processing

### Required Components

#### 1. WebRTC Media Server
**Options** (in order of recommendation):
- **MediaSoup** (Node.js) - Fits your stack perfectly
- **LiveKit** (Go-based) - Most features, including built-in audio mixing
- **Janus Gateway** (C) - Battle-tested but more complex

#### 2. Signaling Layer
- Use existing unified WebSocket (`/api/v69/ws`)
- New topic: `voice-room`
- Handles: join/leave, ICE candidates, room state

#### 3. Audio Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// Server-side audio flow
WebRTC Audio Streams ‚Üí Audio Mixer ‚Üí Encoder ‚Üí OpenAI
                           ‚Üì
                    Room Participants ‚Üê Broadcaster ‚Üê Didi Audio
```

## üìã Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure (Week 1)
- [ ] Install and configure MediaSoup
- [ ] Create voice room service in backend
- [ ] Set up STUN/TURN servers
- [ ] Integrate with unified WebSocket for signaling
- [ ] Basic room creation/joining logic

### Phase 2: Audio Pipeline (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement audio mixing for multiple streams
- [ ] Create OpenAI Realtime API integration
- [ ] Handle audio format conversion (WebRTC ‚Üí OpenAI format)
- [ ] Implement broadcast system for Didi's responses
- [ ] Add push-to-talk functionality

### Phase 3: Terminal Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Update VoiceInput component for room mode
- [ ] Create room UI in terminal (participant list, speaking indicators)
- [ ] Add visual feedback (waveforms, who's speaking)
- [ ] Implement room controls (mute, leave, etc.)
- [ ] Add connection status indicators

### Phase 4: UX Polish & Modes (Week 4)
- [ ] Implement different room modes:
  - "Pass the Mic" - Token-based speaking
  - "Open Forum" - Everyone can speak
  - "Didi's Show" - Didi leads conversation
- [ ] Add voice activity detection
- [ ] Create room persistence/reconnection
- [ ] Add text fallback in terminal
- [ ] Implement admin controls

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Structure
```
/services
  /voice
    /VoiceRoomService.js       # Room management
    /AudioMixerService.js      # Mixing multiple streams
    /OpenAIVoiceService.js     # Realtime API integration
    /MediaServerAdapter.js     # MediaSoup wrapper

/websocket/topics
  /voice-room.js              # WebSocket topic handler
```

### Frontend Structure
```
/components/terminal/voice-room
  /VoiceRoomUI.tsx           # Main room interface
  /ParticipantsList.tsx      # Who's in the room
  /SpeakingIndicator.tsx     # Visual feedback
  /AudioVisualizer.tsx       # Waveforms
  /RoomControls.tsx          # Mute/leave/settings
```

### Cloudflare & NGINX Configuration

#### Cloudflare Setup
```yaml
# Already supports WebSockets
# Ensure these settings:
- WebSocket support: ON
- HTTP/2: ON
- 100MB upload limit (audio chunks)
```

#### NGINX Configuration
```nginx
# Add to existing config
location /voice/media {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3006;  # MediaSoup port
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
}
```

### STUN/TURN Configuration
```javascript
// Use Cloudflare's TURN or host your own
const iceServers = [
  { urls: 'stun:stun.cloudflare.com:3478' },
  { 
    urls: 'turn:turn.cloudflare.com:3478',
    username: 'your-turn-username',
    credential: 'your-turn-password'
  }
];
```

} else if (multipleUsersSpeaking) {
  mixAllStreamsEqually();
}
```

### Conversation Memory

- Text transcript alongside audio

## üìä Performance Targets

- Support 10-20 concurrent speakers per room
- < 200ms audio latency
- Smooth handling of join/leave
- Graceful degradation on poor connections

- Admin/SuperAdmin can moderate rooms
- Kick/ban functionality
- Audio recording options (with consent)
- Rate limiting per user
- Profanity filtering option

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### OpenAI Costs
- Single API connection per room (not per user!)
- Implement silence detection to pause API usage
- Room timeout after inactivity
- Usage caps per room/user

### Bandwidth Optimization
- Adaptive bitrate based on participants
- Opus codec for efficiency
- Regional TURN servers via Cloudflare

## üéØ Success Metrics

1. **Technical**: < 200ms latency, 99% uptime
2. **User Engagement**: Avg session > 10 minutes
3. **Social**: Multiple users talking together
4. **AI Quality**: Didi contributing meaningfully

## üöß Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Multiple people talking at once
**Solution**: Voice activity indicators + smart mixing + "raise hand" feature

### Challenge: Echo/feedback
**Solution**: WebRTC echo cancellation + headphone detection

### Challenge: Mobile browser support
**Solution**: Progressive enhancement + fallback to text

### Challenge: Scaling beyond 20 users
**Solution**: Room sharding + multiple media servers

## üé™ The "Wow" Factor

This isn't just voice chat - it's the first social AI voice experience where:
- The AI is a room participant, not a service
- Natural group conversations with AI
- Integrated with your trading platform
- Happens inside a terminal (!)

## üèÅ Next Steps

1. Validate OpenAI Realtime API access
2. Choose media server (recommend MediaSoup)
3. Create proof-of-concept with 2 users + Didi
4. Design terminal UI mockups
5. Set up development environment

---

**Remember**: We're not building "Discord with AI". We're creating something entirely new - a social AI experience native to DegenDuel's terminal-first design.
